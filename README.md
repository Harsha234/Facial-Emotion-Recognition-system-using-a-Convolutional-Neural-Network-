Objective-The objective of this project is to design and implement a Facial Emotion Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can accurately detect and classify human emotions from facial images. The goal is to build an efficient model capable of identifying seven basic emotions—angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral—by analyzing visual features, thereby enabling emotion-aware applications in fields like human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and intelligent surveillance systems.
